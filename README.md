## Java Projects (Codsoft Internship)

During my Codsoft Internship, I developed the following Java projects:

1Ô∏è‚É£ ATM Machine

A simple console-based ATM simulation using Java.

Users can check balance, deposit, withdraw, and exit.

Demonstrates OOP concepts like classes, methods.

Focused on basic banking operations and user interaction.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Student Grade Card

A Java program to calculate and display student grades.

Takes marks of subjects as input.

Calculates total, percentage, and grade.

Useful for practicing decision-making (if-else, switch) and loops.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Guess Number Game üéÆ

An interactive number guessing game in Java.

You can play against the computer (system generates random number).

Or play with multiple friends by taking turns.

Demonstrates use of random numbers, loops, and conditions.

‚úÖ These projects helped me strengthen my Java programming skills in logic building, problem-solving, and OOP concepts.
